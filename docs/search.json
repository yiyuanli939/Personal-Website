The core design logic of quarto-cli following the command style\nquarto &lt;verb&gt; [target] [options]\nCommon verbs mirror the workflow: - render — run the full pipeline - preview — render + live reload server - publish — render + deploy to hosting - create — scaffold new projects - check — diagnose environment issues"

    "text": "Project Structure\nThere are several files that need extra attention, First, in _quarto.yml all the configurations are stored here. It is the infrastrcutre of all the important information of the project. As in 2025.12, my _quarto.yml looks like\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Yiyuan Li\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home # homepage link \n      - href: blog.qmd \n        text: Blog\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme:\n      - cosmo\n      - styles.scss \n    toc: true\nEverything in here is yaml mapping. According to the definitive guide of quarto, all the yaml mapping can be described as key: value pairs. Here, the value can be int, boolean, string, a set of ordered values, and another map. The possible options, different from the syntax regulation, are be review in the reference of quartos’ document.\nBut why? We can treat the hierarchical design of the YAML system as a systematic way to balance the consistency and flexibility of the contents within the same project. Thus, _quarto.yml provides information of the whole project, front_matter on top of each file provides page level information that can override the genernal information. Of course, for each directory (folder), we can design directory only _metadata.yml. However, there are some configuratiosn that are _quarto.yml only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteQuarto project options\n\n\n\n\n\n# Project definition\nproject:\n  type: website | book | manuscript | default\n  output-dir: _site\n  resources: []\n  preview:\n    port: 4200\n    browser: true\n\n# Website structure\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Site Title\"\n  navbar: ...\n  sidebar: ...\n  search: ...\n  page-footer: ...\n  site-url: \"https://example.com\"\n\n# Book structure  \nbook:\n  title: \"Book Title\"\n  chapters: ...\n  appendices: ...\n  \n# Manuscript structure\nmanuscript:\n  article: article.qmd\n  notebooks: ...\n\n# Build profiles\nprofile:\n  default: production\n  group: [[a, b]]\n\n# External metadata files\nmetadata-files:\n  - _variables.yml\n\n# Publishing targets\npublish:\n  provider: gh-pages\n\n\n\nIn _metadata.yml, we mostly focus on format. The layered strcture makes any specific function has its own style."
