As a person with humanity and statistics background doing LLM today, quarto is one of a few "pearls" I inherited from the statistics community. The primary advantage I would love to work on is the 

We can create a variety of format using relative simple grammar  [@shanny-csikCreatingYourPersonal2022]. If I want to create a citation in my blog, what I need to do is only add several lines in my yaml header in blow. 
```{yaml}
#| code-fold: true
citeproc: true                                             # use cite processor 
csl: references/association-for-computational-linguistics  # use the style installed 
bibliography: "references/Website (Personal).bib"          # use the citations exported by zotero
```


The second advantage is the potentlity of code chuck formats

- `#|code-fold: true` to let readers collapse the block.
- `#| code-summary: "Citation settings"` to label the folded block.
- `#| code-copy: true` to show a copy-to-clipboard button.
- `#| code-tools: true` for the toolbar (copy/download).
- `#| code-line-numbers: true` to number lines.
- `#| code-overflow: wrap` or `scroll` to control horizontal overflow.
- `#| ode-block-bg: false` to remove the background if you want the snippet to blend in.
